The final notebook is `main.ipynb`.

The folder structure is as follows -

```
- app
    - models
    - datasets
    - explainibility
    - utils
- main.ipynb
```

The `models` folder contains the code for ResNet. The `datsets` folder contains the PyTorch dataset for TinyImageNet. The `explainibility` folder contains code for GradCAM and `utils` folder contains all the other misc functions such as train/test loops, visualization, transformations etc.

## Image Transformations

## Loss Acc Curves

## Confusion Matrix

## Misclassified Examples

## GradCAM
